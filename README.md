Trying to build Apps in C/C++

## Note about languages Used
Most of the code will be in .cpp files. However, the code contained in those files will be almost exclusively C code. I don't intend to use many C++ features at all and there won't be any OOP in this project.

If I ever wanted to change that, I would make a new project for that purpose.
