Trying to build Apps in C/C++

Currently working on building a fundamental understanding of Computer graphics by implementing some basic rendering methods from scratch. 

The platform layer of this project is inspired by the [HandmadeHero project](https://handmadehero.org/). Some of the math used is based on the [Scratchpixel 2.0 blog](https://www.scratchapixel.com/index.php?redirect).

## Note about languages Used
Most of the code will be in .cpp files. However, the code contained in those files will be almost exclusively C code. I don't intend to use many C++ features at all and there won't be any OOP in this project.

If I ever wanted to change that, I would make a new project for that purpose.
